# SORT---Codechef
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the second-maximum number among the three.
## Input
First line contains the number of triples, N.
The next N lines which follow each have three space separated integers.
## Output
For each of the N triples, output one new line which contains the second-maximum integer among the three.

## Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 6
1 ≤ every integer ≤ 10000
The three integers in a single triplet are all distinct. That is, no two of them are equal.
## Sample 1:

   10  15   5           10
   100 999 500          500
